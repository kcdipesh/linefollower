linefollower
============

In German schools in grade 11 you have to do a big project, called "Komplexe
Leistung". The topic is chosen at the beginning of the year and than you
have to work on it usually until the end of the year. This work includes a
practical part and you also have to do the documentation and a
presentation.

For this project, I build a little linefollower based on an Arduino Uno.
